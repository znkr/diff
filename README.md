# diff

A difference algorithm module for Go.

Difference algorithms compare two inputs and find the edits that transform one to the other. This is
very useful to understand changes, for example when comparing a test result with the tests
expectation or to understand which changes have been made to a file.

This module provides diffing for arbitrary Go slices.
